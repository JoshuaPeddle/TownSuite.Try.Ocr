CRANKSHAFT FORCES
Each time combustion occurs, the force deflects the
crankshaft as it transfers torque to the output shaft.
This deflection occurs in two ways, to bend the shaft
sideways and to twist the shaft in torsion. The crank-
shaft must be rigid enough to keep the deflection forces
to a minimum.
Crankshaft deflections are directly related to oper-
ating roughness of an engine. When back-and-forth
