Clarification
In the last edition of the “Catholic New World.” an
article on the annual conference hosted by the Re-
spect Life Office did not fully reflect the context of
Cardinal George's remarks.
During an informal question-and-answer session
with the archdiocese’s parish Respect Life Coordi-
nators, the cardinal emphasized that the participa-
tion by any person in the promotion of abortion, in-
cluding through his or her political position, is a
grave matter. While the issue of withholding Com-
munion-from some of these individuals can be
complex, Cardinal George said that when any per-
son presents him or herself to receive the Eucharist,
they “take their salvation into their own hands.” For
a more complete explanation of this matter, refer-
ence the cardinal’s column “Catholic participation
in political life, revisited” (CNW, Oct. 10, 2004)
